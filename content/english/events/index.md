## Join us at an event
We aim to hold a meetup every two months, all **free** at the point of use thanks to the continued support of our sponsors. We do run our events with tickets, so when we are running physical events we need to ensure we don't exceed the amount of seats we have and adhere to our venues' fire codes.  As we said though our events are free, so signing up for a ticket is quick via [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/glasgow-azure-user-group-13843919802) or [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/glasgow-azure-user-group).  Please only sign up for a ticket from one platform.  Also if you sign up and then cannot make the event please do cancel your ticket. ðŸ˜‰
