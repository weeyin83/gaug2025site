We donâ€™t have the time or energy to do anything nefarious with your data. Itâ€™s not that we\u0026rsquo;re not evil â€“ we\u0026rsquo;re as corruptible as anyone â€“ we\u0026rsquo;re just too tired to think up a malevolent plot to steal your identity.\nCookies Seriously who actually cares? Do you even know what a cookie is or does? Well then. Yes we use cookies because thatâ€™s kinda how the Internet works. If you donâ€™t want our delicious home-baked chocolate chip scripts, then you need to block cookies on your browser but donâ€™t come crying to us when nothing does what itâ€™s supposed to.\nStalky Visitor Tracking Look, weâ€™re following you, ok? We use Google Analytics and Lite Analytics, primarily to stare at the real time stats because theyâ€™re cool but also to see what you like visiting and don\u0026rsquo;t like visiting.\nNone of these things store any super personal data about you but probably they nab your IP address, not that we know where to look for it or what to do with it. All we see is that a person or many people have interacted with the website in a particular way. You can mess with us by doing something totally unexpected on the website and skewing our stats. Or you could do something way more fun and useful with your time LIKE WRITING.\nData Storage DATA!! Itâ€™s all about the data, baby. A tonne of petabytes whirring around the world and what? Whatâ€™s it all for? WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? What will future historians actually see of us and our slowly collapsing society? So. We store your data on this website. You ready for this?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s be honest: we do absolutely nothing unsurprising or radical with your info.\nSocial Media We use social media a lot. If you talk to us on one platform and we become familiar with you, we might find you on Twitter and say hello. You can ask us to be less friendly if you wish and we will of course respect your boundaries.\n","date":"January 1, 1","image":"//localhost:1313/images/gaug-2024_hu1354317109487501505.png","permalink":"/privacy/","title":"Privacy Policy"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Sponsors We are looking forward to working with the following partners to bring you the Glasgow Azure User Group events.\nGold Sponsors Telefonica Tech UK are a leading Microsoft Dynamics (AX, NAV and CRM) and Dynamics 365 partner with a wide range of services including Azure, Data Science and Power BI.
